          the participation of every member of the Python community and want all
          attendees to have an enjoyable and rewarding experience. Accordingly,
          every attendee of the conference is expected to show respect and
          courtesy to every other attendee throughout the conference and at all
          conference related events, whether officially organized by PSSI or
